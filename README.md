# GenshinKey

![Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-1.0-blue)

Keyboard controls for Genshin Imapact on Apple Silicon Macs.

## Project Info

The project is inspired by [AmongKey by andresavic](https://github.com/andresavic/AmongKey), a lot of thanks to him!

Cause Genshin Impact only support using game controller (e.g. DS4) currently, so I came up the idea to modified keyboard to in-game control.

## Issues & TODO

The most ideal situation is to simulate game controllers input signal, but currently I have no idea how to do this, and because I'm not familiar with Swift lang, it might be some buggy if you press other key when rotating perspective.

The program has only been tested on Macbook Air M1, not sure if it can successfully works on Macbook Pro version.

If you have any interesting idea or want to contribute, any help is appreciate!
